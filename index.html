            under the Mahabodhi Tree is now occupied by the Mahabodhi Temple, which attracts Buddhist pilgrims and travellers 
            from around the world.

                  Gaya is 15 km from Gaya and is about 96 km (60 mi) from Patna. The site contains a descendant of
                   the Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha gained enlightenment, 
                and has been a major pilgrimage destination of Buddhists for over two thousand years.

                    Vishwa Shanti Stupa, also called the Peace Pagoda. It is located at the highest point of Ratnagiri hill, at 
                    an altitude of 400 m in Rajgir, qualifying its serene charm as divine. Built completely with marble, Stupa 
                    comprises four golden statues of Lord Buddha with each representing his life periods of
                     birth, enlightenment, preaching and death. There is a ropeway which helps the tourists reach Vishwa

                    The Barabar Caves lie about 31 km (19.3 mi.) to the north of Bodh Gaya , a pilgrimage site sacred to Buddhists, 
                    as it is believed to be the site where the Buddha attained enlightenment. Due to the association of the Barabar
                     Caves with the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, one would assume that they too have some connection with Buddhism. 
                     The inverted swastika with an upward arrow at the end of the inscription suggests that <strong>Karan Chaupar cave</strong> of the four Barabar Caves was reserved for Buddhist monks.
                     A mound decorated with later Buddhist sculptures is also near the entrance giving evidence that the cave belonged to Buddhists.

                    Nalanda was an acclaimed Mahavihara, a large Buddhist monastery in the ancient kingdom of Magadha (modern-day Bihar) in India. The site is located about 95 kilometres southeast of Patna near the town of Bihar Sharif,
                     and was a centre of learning from the fifth century CE to1200 CE. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
                     <br>
                     Nalanda was established during the Gupta Empire era and was supported by numerous Indian and Javanese patrons both Buddhists 
                     and non-Buddhists.Over some 750 years, its faculty included some of the most revered scholars of Mahayana Buddhism.
                      Nalanda mahavihara taught six major Buddhist schools 
                     and philosophies such as Yogachara and Sarvastivada as well as subjects such as Vedas, grammar, medicine, logic and mathematics.
                     <br>
                     Early Buddhist texts state that Buddha visited a town near Rajagriha called Nalanda on his preregrinations. He delivered lectures
                      in a nearby mango grove named Pavarika and one of his two
                      chief disciples, Shariputra, was born in the area and later attained nirvana there.

                    Kolhua is a famous Buddhist excavation site situated approximately 65 km North-West of Patna. The excavations have revealed the famous Ashokan Pillar having a
                    statue of lion on the top. Excavations also revealed, many other articles related to Buddhism.<br>
                    It is an old Buddhist archeological site with ruins from the Maurya period, Kushan era etc. The relic stupa, Ashokan Pillar, tanks and others ruins make it a part of the must visit international 
                    Buddhist Circuit in Bihar. This is also where Gautam Buddha spent some of his important years.
                    Emperor Ashoka built The Lion Pillar at Kolhua. It is made of a highly polished single piece of red sandstone, surmounted by a bell shaped capital, 18.3 m high. A life-size figure of a lion is placed on top of the pillar.
                     There is a small tank here known as Ramkund. This pillar beside a brick stupa at Kolhua commemorates Buddha's last sermon.

                    <strong>One of the most popular sites for Buddhists, this site enshrines the holy ashes of Lord Buddha.</strong><br>
                    Buddha Relic Stupa, enshrining one of the eight parts of the mortal remains of Lord Buddha after he attained Mahaparinirvana,
                     is one of the most revered sites for Buddhists and a protected one for Archaeological
                     Survey of India (ASI), located around 55km northwest of Patna in Vaishali district.
                     There are two stupas, Stupa 1 and Stupa 2 which are named based on their discovery and excavation. 
                     Both of them have the ashes of Lord Buddha preserved in stone caskets. Situated near the Coronation Tank or Abhishek Pushkarini, 
                     the Stupa 1 or the Relic Stupa was excavated by Dr. A.S.Altekar in 1985, and inside, a stone casket was found containing some 
                     ashes and 'Manka'. That casket is now with the Patna Museum.According to the legend, after the
                      salvation of Lord Buddha, his ashes were divided and distributed among 8 kings of those times, and Licchavis of Vaishali were one of them.
                      The Licchavis built a stupa at this place over their share of the Buddha's relic.
